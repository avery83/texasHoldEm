## Problem Statement:
I had a hard time coming up with an idea but I eventually decided that I wanted to make some type of game. I used to play a ton of Texas Hold'em way back when it was cool, and legal to play online, so I thought I would try to develop a game that I know a lot about already.
I figured the application would have a user log in and choose the settings for the game; i.e., number of players, starting chips, blind values. Then the user would be able to play a game vs the computer. The results would then be stored into a database. I also thought it would be cool to throw in a odds calculator, but I'll see how things go.
